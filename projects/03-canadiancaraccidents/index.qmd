Project developed as part of the Master in Data Science at CUNEF Universidad. Together with my colleague [√Ålvaro Serrano](https://github.com/aserincon) we develop a model for predicting car accident severity with the help of [Kaggle's Canadian Car Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tbsteal/canadian-car-accidents-19942014)

## The model

The first part of the work was understanding the data, cleaning and view how we can build a model with it. With an Exploratory Data Analysis we decide the most suitable variables and detect anomalies like duplicate registers, outliers, etc.

Once deeply studied the data, we try to choose different models. Among the used ones, we can remark decision trees, random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost and lightGBM. With the use of key metrics such as precision, recall and visual analysis with confusion matrix we compare the different models.The decision behind this metrics resides in the highly unbalanced sample of data making not reliable the use of metrics such as accuracy. Finally, XGBoost was our best model for predict car accident severity. 

Finally, we optimize the model improving hiperparameters and with the help of Sapley Values method we try to explain the inner working of the model to understand the reasons behind its predictions and avoid the "black box" of a machine learning model. 

You can see our full work with plenty of detail and detailed explanations in different notebooks in our [repository](https://github.com/carviagu/canadian_car_accidents) (Spanish). 

## API

For second part, we decide to create an API with our model so it can be used for making predictions and being called. For doing this we use flask framework, the API was implemented with a full logging system for record errors, calls and have full historic of tasks done. All was built inside a docker container to facilitate deployment. 

You can find the API code and all work done in the [repository](https://github.com/carviagu/canadian_car_accidents_api/tree/main) (Spanish)
