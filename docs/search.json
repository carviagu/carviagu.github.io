Among the different areas where technological advancements have given us improvements and change how we operate, we can highlight the financial sector, where innovation has changed substantially the different processes involved in their services and financial structures. We can focus on the improvements obtained in the payment systems due to the necessity of reliability, security, and immediacy in the process of transfer money between the different agents in the economy.\nThese advancements in the payment systems are the result of different causes, especially the development of new business models based on technology and the intrusion of bigtech companies, increasing their presence in the payment industry. The development of new technologies and their applications in this area are also one of the main reasons behind this revolution. This has forced banks and other financial institutions to accelerate their innovation process to reach new customers and cope with these new companies.\nIn this paper, we will focus our study on the payment systems, how they operate, and the different payment services related. We will identify the main threats and opportunities is facing the payment industry and how financial entities and banks are managing their strategies to deal with these situations"

First, we look for summarize the different concepts regarding financial entities, banking system and payments in Spain and European Union. Second, we focus on changes occurring at the payment sector, new competitors as bigtech companies, new payment systems as cripto-currencies or digital money. In addition, we make an analysis of the different strategies being followed by the different banks inside the Spanish financial system, making a comparison between their strengths and opportunities to compete and develop at the sector.\nBetween the conclusions, we understand the importance of the payment system for the banking institutions, being cooperation and investment in start-ups the main strategies for compete and develop new business cases. And we emphasize the importance of the technological evolution for this sector, being the new payment systems related with cripto-currencies and digital money key aspects.\n\n\n\nViñals Guitart, C.

With an Exploratory Data Analysis we decide the most suitable variables and detect anomalies like duplicate registers, outliers, etc.\nOnce deeply studied the data, we try to choose different models. Among the used ones, we can remark decision trees, random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost and lightGBM. With the use of key metrics such as precision, recall and visual analysis with confusion matrix we compare the different models.The decision behind this metrics resides in the highly unbalanced sample of data making not reliable the use of metrics such as accuracy. Finally, XGBoost was our best model for predict car accident severity.\nFinally, we optimize the model improving hiperparameters and with the help of Sapley Values method we try to explain the inner working of the model to understand the reasons behind its predictions and avoid the “black box” of a machine learning model.\nYou can see our full work with plenty of detail and detailed explanations in different notebooks in our repository (Spanish)."
